IMPORTANT -- READ BEFORE OPENING

This is a legal agreement between you, the software licensee, and Miles Design, Incorporated
("Miles Design").  By opening this sealed disk package, you are accepting the terms of this
agreement.  If you do not wish to become bound by the terms of this agreement, you should
return the unopened disk package and any related items to Miles Design at the address given
below.

This software program (or programs) is licensed, not sold, and remains the sole property of
Miles Design.  Programs and program components covered by this agreement may take the form
of compilable program instructions ("source code"), compiled but unlinked data or program
functions ("object code"), and application programs, loadable drivers, and data in final form
("executable code").  When any part of the enclosed executable code becomes part of, or is used
in the development of your own products, you may use, give away, lease, sell, or otherwise
distribute an unlimited number of copies of those products without additional license, fees, or
notice of copyright or ownership.  However, no part of the enclosed source or object code, nor
any rendering or descriptive documentation of it, may be distributed to any third party not
actively engaged in designing, developing, testing, marketing, publishing, or translating your
products.  Any use of the enclosed software by any party under any conditions other than those
named above is prohibited by this agreement.  You may transfer your license on a permanent
basis if the party receiving it agrees to the terms of this agreement.  

Miles Design warrants the physical diskettes and physical documentation enclosed herein to be
free of defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety days from the purchase date. 
During this period, Miles Design will replace any defective diskette(s) or documentation without
charge.  Miles Design disclaims all other warranties, express or implied, including but not
limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. 
Specifically, Miles Design makes no representation or warranty that the software is fit for any
particular purpose and any implied warranty of merchantability is limited to the ninety-day
duration of the Limited Warranty covering the physical diskette(s) and physical documentation
only (and not the software) and is otherwise expressly and specifically disclaimed.  This limited
warranty gives you certain legal rights; you may have others which vary from state to state. 
Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, or the limitation
on how long an implied warranty lasts, so some of the above may not apply to you.

The above terms do not apply to any parts of the enclosed software which are not the property of
Miles Design.  However, you shall remain solely responsible for, and will hold Miles Design
harmless from, any claims, liability, and damages arising from the use or misuse of any of your
products which incorporate or were developed with the aid of any part of the enclosed software
or accompanying materials, regardless of ownership.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Texas.

Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, or if you desire to contact Miles
Design for any reason, please write or call Miles Design, 10926 Jollyville #308, Austin, Texas

the result of valuable suggestions and feedback from the product's users.  As a licensee, your
comments are important, and help to ensure the continued improvement of this product.

The Extended MIDI (XMIDI) standard was designed in collaboration with the musicians,
programmers, and developers at Origin Systems in Austin, Texas.  In particular, the author
gratefully acknowledges the expert assistance of Martin Galway, Dana Glover, Chris Roberts,
Marc Schaefgen, Gary Scott Smith, Nenad Vugrinec, and Kirk Winterrowd in the evolution of
the XMIDI standard, as well as their patience in dealing with the stream of almost-daily
"upgrades" during the development process.

Finally, the author wishes to thank Ken Arnold and George ('The Fat Man') Sanger for their
indispensable advice and support.
